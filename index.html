        <p>I am a web developer and founder of Esther Acquaye's Foundation(EAF).Enthusiastic,Confident,Driven,communicative and reliable are five words I'd pick to describe myself.My Enthusiastic for web development and also being the founder and CEO of EAF allows me to stay motivated and find importance in what i'm doing. My confidence helps me recognize my abilities while knowing that there's more room to learn more.I consider myself to be driven because I'm always working toward a new goal and refuse to give up if met with any obstacles.I chose communicative because i greatly enjoy collaborative work and would love the opportunity to learn from others if given the position.finally,I picked reliable because i stick to my commitments.If i volunteer to do something, you can guarantee I'll get it done to the best of my ability. </p></td>
